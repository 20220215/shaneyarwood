Reflective Journal

Week one.

We learned about scratch and had a play with it, scratch is block based that has blocks with commands in them that you can join together
to create various programmes, it is a easy way to get introduced to programming without knowing any coding, as the blocks contain  the
code and fit into each other and lets you see the end results without knowing any coding language.
It seems like a simple thing to use. And was kinda fun to play around with joining them together. And a good way to see how logic works in programming.
Its a visual programming language in itself i think, and if someone was creative which I don't think I am, they would be able to easily use it without 
little training or help to create apps.

I found scratch rather simple, having coded last term and designed and built my own calculator I found it a step down in some respects but the 
creative part was probably good for me as I struggle with creating something from the beginning, I just aren't a creative kind of person I guess, i'd like 
to be but its like a natural kind of talent, maybe I can learn to be i really don't know. I'd like to be...

Week two.

We learned about Github a repository for storing our code to share with others amongst other things, Its all stored online and if you want someone to look at
your code you can simply send them a link. I set up a Github account easily but I'll probably change it as I didnt use my student ID but I can do that later
thats no problem. Github looks interesting and ill have to look around it more as time allows. Ill be able to store all my code in there that or I should say if I am
able to write proper code.
I shall also add my scratch code we did today into there.
Also did a few footnotes and how to write them for explaining our code and lets others look at it and understand it and let them know what we are thinking etc.
So far everything is going fine, having done harder last term I am finding it rather easy but I know that won't continue.

Week three

A different lecturer this week, and back to the programming that I know, well the very basics of it anyway, things like variables and functions and data types and operators.
This is what I had expected the whole course to be like, Roman teaches in a different style, I don't have a preference but I find the straight forward instructions easier to
comprehend. I like both styles and think its good to be exposed to different styles as I am not getting stuck in one way.
I knew some of it already having done level 4 but he introduced a lot of new things as well. Having done the level 4 was a great idea as if I had come right into this class I would be
overwhealmed with it all and would definetly be struggling a lot more. 
I also had a look at some more libraries, there sure is a lot of them, crazy amount really.
I was unfortunely not in class today on a computer so had to watch it all on a tablet, so couldnt program along but I have pycharm installed on computer I use at other place so I will do some practise 
when I get a chance and post any code I write into Github.
I tryed using visual studio code to do the activities with csharp, it was different and took a bit or should I say a lot fo playing around,its kind of similar but different, I shall stick to python if at all possible that is confusing enough. at least for now

Week Four.

I have covid this week I tested positive on saturday so am stuck at home for a week, not able to go and use any computer just having a tablet, I watched the lessons but felt like crap all through and wasn't paying that much attention
to it, I tried but couldn't concentrate or take anything in. Im worried this is going to set me back, having a week off work and course is really not good at all, but what can you do, it is what it is, hopefully when I am better I can catch up on both
its such bad timing. I read that at lab session people made a video of each other doing things, to be honest i am kind of glad that this is the week I got sick after learning that.

Week Five.

Learnt graphs and data science fundamentals as well as machine learning bias, I followed along and kind of understood some of the things and struggled with others, its gettiing harder now and understanding all the different
concepts is ok its kind of hard to wrap your mind around. Some of it is a lot different then i expected but that isn't a bad thing, its all a part of learning and i need to open my mind to it more, especially Agile and MVP with the practical challenge part I found it interesting
and gave me a lot of things to mull over and a different way of doing things, more abstract I don't know if that is the correct word but that will do. I need to put my coding that I have done into my new repository as well at some time, but once again finding the time outside of class 
isn't easy, I yet again wish I wasn't working full time at the same time as I was doing this, a good lesson for the future, to commit more to it for a better result. Im not unhappy with how it is all going but I feel I could achieve so much more if I had more time.
And interestingly enough the more studying I do the easier it is getting, I didn't know if I could study again after never really doing anything like this before, and im pleasently surprised how much I actually enjoy sitting down in front of the computer and learning new things
like I did last term, this term is a lot more self directed I could do everything in class alone last term and that lulled me into thinking this term would be the same but we learn in class but then I have a lot of other stuff to practise and get right in my own time.

Week six.

I managed to miss the first 20 minutes as I didnt see the notification that it was in Bigbluebutton, what a idiot, and that left me scratching my head for the reminder, luckily he went back over the start again as I wasn't the only one to miss it, we learned about Koans, Koans seem to be puzzles
that you have to find answers that evaluate to be true before you can move on, at least that is what I kind of understood them to be, i'll have to look more when I have more time in the lab, I was very confused about them and how to use them, It definetly was a lot harder then anything else I have done 
before this, I really didn't wrap my head around them much, but often I need to do something over and over again before I can understand it and work out what it all means and how it all work,
almost like repititious learning. I am thinking it may take awhile before I understand them. I also struggled just to get it to run properly, 
it doesn't seem that straight forward to get it working, I did manage to when I went home and loaded it onto the computer there, that's always ran well for me for some reasom, I was doing the same thing to install and run it as the lab computer but it works there and not the other one, very strange.
As i worked my way through the puzzles or tryed to I kind of could begin to wrap my head around it a lot more, the more I do the easier it becomes, like everything I guess.
I also think that the repository is due to be handed in on Friday so i'll transfer my home and lab stuff all together and upload it to Github, I don't see any problems there.
