### Some reflective questions.

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
# Yes i did, I get a sore back if I sit to long so need to stretch every hour, a qucik 2 minute walk is all thats needed.

### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?
# A time box is setting yourself a fixed period of time for a task. The amount of time depends on the task.
# This is the first time I have heard of it, and yes I would use it in the future.

### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?
# About a 2.5, I am a bit unsure of a lot of stuff but being new to programming that is to be expected and I arent a overconfident person 
# so that  will influence how confident I am about things until I have done them.

### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?
# Well, as I have never studied anything before as I left school at 15 and never enjoyed it, I am a truck driver by trade and am now 
# midlife and decided to try something different, I always enjoyed computers and technology and thought I would try retraining as I am bored with
# truck driving and dont want to do it the rest of my life, but making a change like this is rather huge for me. And going back to school after all these
# years was a challenge. I thought and hoped since I enjoy doing it I would be able to study and see where it took me. Also as I still work full time about 50 hours
# a week, finding the time to study has been very hard. 

### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 
# no I don't have a learning strategy, I have faced many problems, the main one juggling full time work with finding the time to spend learning. It hasn't been easy and if I keep studying after this level 
# I shall have to make some major life choices. I don't see how I can work full time and study at the same time, its just do able at the moment but as it gets harder 
# and I have to make more of a commitment , there are lots of unanswered questions. Like work or study. How do I pay the bills and support family if I can't bring in the same level of income.
# Is it worth me doing mores study. What if I commit to more study and don't do well .

### If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
# Don't try and work fultime and do the course, cut your hours back to 20 a week.

### What is Python?
#  Python is a programming language, it is high level, general purpose interpreted. It is easy to learn read and to write apparently but im unsure of that still.

### Have you developed a habit of exploring?
# I have found I learn best when I explore like just clicking on things and seeing what they do,as I don't have a good memory I find learning like this I remember it a lot easier.

### Have you meditated before?
# I have tried it but find it really hard to stay in that zone so to say, my mind drifts easily so I have not tryed it again since.

### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?
# Surfing and snowboarding are my hobbies and where I find peace in myself, I love doing and when you love doing something its never a chore, it takes a bit a practise but its easy really.

### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?
# No, not at all, I am ok if i have been given something final to work towards but if I have to think of the idea in the first place I do struggle with that.

### Do you value creativity? As a value itself? What about as a tool for learning to think logically?
# Sure I value creativity, I envy creative people, like artists, who can create something from nothing. I don't correlate creativity with learning, I may be looking at it wrong
# but as I am not creative maybe its more I don't want it to be a prerequisite to think logically. I think I think logically or am learning how to I hope.

### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?
# I have 10 tabs open plus wordpad and pycharm. and no distraction tabs as im in the lab. At home it would be different, I usually have to many distraction tabs.

### Have you had a fight response to technology? What does it feel like? How did you overcome this?
# No i have always enjoyed working with technology, for example I worked for Fonterra driving milk tankers, and we went from a visual site glass to measure how much milk we collected from a farm 
# to a metered computer which monitors everything like milk temp, flow rate, certain test etc, a lot of the other drivers seemed to struggle with learning how to use the truck computer but I picked it up straight away
# and it made life so much easier, same with the InCab computer system which had a gps, maps, collection and dropoff details amongst other things. 

### What is an IDE?
# Integrated Development Environment. It is software for building apps and combines tools for developers into a single GUI.

### What did you learn out of the Marshmallow Challenge?
# I learned that the marshmallow challenge is supposed to teach that experimentation, prototyping, and iterations are essential to achieving success. 

### Did you have any blocks during this challenge? How did you overcome them?
# Working with people I don't know is a block in itself for me.

### So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
# Trying to grasp this different style of learning, like not having a project with a clear defined goal, I mean I know this is a clear defined goal in of itself,
# last term at level 4 everything was a lot more structed and at the end we had a specific task the calculator, so knowing that I had to learn how to write global functions and GUI placement etc made it easier.
# I struggle without clearly defined structure.

### What is OOP?
# Object oriented programming,  programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data and code, data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. 
# That is the google answer and I know what it is yet I can't put it into a better description then that.

### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?
# Yes canvas has been extremely helpful, It has lots of guides and instructions, One of the first things i do is open canvas before study.

### Which parts of the work did you find tedious?
# I don't know if I found any of it tedious, I have enjoyed learning it all, finding the time has probably been the hardest part for me.

### What is polymorphism?
# Polymorphism is an concept that refers to the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms, it allows developers to program in general form rather than specific form.

### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
# I am always hearing critical voices in my head, is this normal? anyway from the start before I even enrolled I hear or I should say I think voices that tell me I can't do this or I will not be able to learn that,
# I think its natural to hear self criticism, It also depends on my mood,like if im in a happy confident mood I think that I can achieve anything, at the other end first thing in the morning generally I have self doubt if this is what is right for me
# or am I just wasting my time and ill look like a fool, especially when we have to do the presentations.

### What is an MVP? How would you describe it to a group of 6 year olds?
# MVP minimum viable product. to 6 year olds I would describe it...as a way to learn what the person wants before you fully make it.

### What is the hardest problem you have solved so far?
# Learning how to or I should say discovering how to write correct programming for converting different calculations. It took me a good day before I found what I was doing wrong.

### What is pair programming?
# Two programmers working at the same station one writes the code and the other reviews each line as it is typed in.

### What are you looking forward to learning about programming?
# Maybe more HTML, i really enjoyed coding up a website, and seeing the end reslut it was very satisfying. And being able to show it off was rewarding.

### What is conscious listening?
# The ability to properly listen to the other person and their needs as well as your own, using empathy and understanding when listening.

### What is a variable?
# A way of storing information in a program, its value can change  depending on conditions or information the program gets. They can be read, created and updated.

### What programming languages are you interested in learning? Why?
# HTML, because I have found it easier then python to learn and understand and I like seeing the finished results in mainly graphical form in a webpage I have just designed.

### What is something kind that someone has done for you?
# Ive had so many people do kiind things I really don't know where to start. Why just on my way to class this morning someone let me in in traffic, and i gave them a thankyou wave.

### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?
# I would say that it is easier then I thought to learn in my parts but it is also hard to learn and understand in many parts as well, the more I learn sometimes the harder it seems to get.

### Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?
# The thought process of thinking up something from the very begginning, not having any clear end goal that I need to create, not having the same structure and having to think more laterally and more constructively that I am used to.

### What is a fixed mindset?
# People who believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. That they cannot learn anything new. That they are stuck in their ways.
